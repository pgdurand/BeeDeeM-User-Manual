# Directory structure

The following table gives the directories that will be used by BeeDeeM \(1\):

| Alias | Description | Default value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _installDir_ | contains binaries, scripts and configuration files | /opt/beedeem |
| _workingDir_ | contains files created by BeeDeeM at runtime, such as logs and other temporary files | /var/beedeem |
| _biobaseRootDir_ | contains installed databases | /biobase |

These directories can be changed during _BeeDeeM_ installation. They can also be updated during the life cycle of the software, as needed.

In the rest of this manual, the alias names shown above will be used to designate the _BeeDeeM_ directories. For example, _${installDir}_ will designate the _BeeDeeM_ system install directory.

_\(1\) by default we consider an installation made on a Linux system._
