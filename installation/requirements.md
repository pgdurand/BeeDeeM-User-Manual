_BeeDeeM_ is a pure Java software... as a result it is available for _Linux_, _MacOS X and Windows_ operating systems.

The following systems must be installed before installing _BeeDeeM_: _JRE_.

The following system is supplied in the _BeeDeeM_ distribution: _Ant_.

## Hardware

Being a bioinformatics databanks manager software, _BeeDeeM_ mostly requires a potentialy huge amont of disk storage; of course, it fully depends on your needs. Generally, the disk space required must be at least twice the size of the databases to be generated. In effect, when _BeeDeeM_ installs a new version of a database, its already installed copy remains available to the users.
