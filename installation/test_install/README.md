# Quick start guide

In this section we present the use of BeeDeeM command-line tools whatever the installation you use (legacy, Docker, Singularity or Conda).&#x20;

So, when we say: "use install.sh tool to do....", you will have to adapt the command-line to conform to your installation. Examples:

* Legacy and Conda installations: you can invoke BeeDeeM tools directly, since BeeDeeM tools path is added in your PATH environment variable
* Docker: prefix BeeDeeM command-line tool name with: "docker run .../..."
* Singularity: prefix BeeDeeM command-line tool name with: "singularity run .../..."
