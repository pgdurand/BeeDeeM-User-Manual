# Requirements

*BeeDeeM* is a pure Java software... as a result it is available for _Linux_, _MacOS X  and  Windows_ operating systems.

### Software

*BeeDeeM* uses the following systems:

* for installation and use: an [_Oracle Java Runtime Environment_ \(JRE\)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), version 1.7 or higher

* for installation only: an [_Apache Ant_ script runner](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi), version 1.9 or higher

The following systems must be installed before installing *BeeDeeM*: _JRE_.

The following system is supplied in the *BeeDeeM* distribution: _Ant_.

### Hardware

Being a bioinformatics databanks manager software, *BeeDeeM* mostly requires a potentialy huge amont of disk storage; of course, it fully depends on your needs. Generally, the disk space required must be at least twice the size of the databases to be generated. In effect, when *BeeDeeM* installs a new version of a database, its already installed copy remains available to the users.
