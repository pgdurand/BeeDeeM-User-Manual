# Deleting your databanks

At any time, you can remove a databank by hitting the ![Local Image](./images/dbdelete2.png) button located at the bottom of the panel called Installed Databanks (right side of the Databank Manager panel). 

A dialogue box pops up asking for a confirmation: indeed, a databank deletion has no way back. 

A second dialogue box will pop up to ask you whether or not you want to remove all the databank files. If you say [Yes], then the databank is fully removed from your disk storage. If you click [No], then the databank files remain on your disk storage, but the databank link disappears from your list of available databanks.
