# Utility tools

*BeeDeeM* comes with two additional command-line tools:

* [query](/utility/cmdline-query.md).\[sh\|bat\]: a tool to query *BeeDeeM* by entity ID
* [annotate](/utility/cmdline-annotate.md).\[sh\|bat\]: a tool to annotate BLAST results
* [info](/utility/list-banks.md).\[sh\|bat\]: a tool to list install banks

*Note:* during script execution, there is nothing displayed on the terminal whether something goes OK or wrong. However, *BeeDeeM* logs all its work in a dedicated log file located in ${workingDir}. Refer to [Directory structure](/directory_structure.md) for more information.
