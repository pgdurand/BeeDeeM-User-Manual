# Utility tools

_BeeDeeM_ comes with two additional command-line tools:

* [query](cmdline-query.md).\[sh\|bat\]: a tool to query _BeeDeeM_ by entity ID
* [annotate](cmdline-annotate.md).\[sh\|bat\]: a tool to annotate BLAST results
* [info](list-banks.md).\[sh\|bat\]: a tool to list install banks

_Note:_ during script execution, there is nothing displayed on the terminal whether something goes OK or wrong. However, _BeeDeeM_ logs all its work in a dedicated log file located in ${workingDir}. Refer to [Directory structure](../installation/directory_structure.md) for more information.
